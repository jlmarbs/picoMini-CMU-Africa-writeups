## DESCRIPTION
A friendly program wants to greet you… but its goodbye might say more than it should. Can you convince it to reveal the flag?

## MY PROCESS
Before connecting to the instance, I took a look at the source code:

I noticed a function that is being called in the main function that might be vulnerable. Upon looking at the `fun` function's code, that's where I realized that the vulnerability will appear at the input that will get passed to the `fun` function.

The reason behind that is, the `fun` function has a smaller buffer and it is copied by using `strcpy`. That will not check the size of the data that is being copied, hence buffer overflow will happen if the input is larger than the buffer which has an array size of 10. As a result, when `system(c)` is called, we can run commands if we know what the OS of the instance (basically we can control the contents in `c[10]`). 

I connected to the instance and immediately tried typing `1234567890uname` in order to find out what OS the instance is using.

After which I run commands like `ls` with `1234567890` padded before the command to see what content is inside the instance.

After that, I read the text file and got the flag.

FLAG: `picoCTF{0v3rfl0w_c0mm4nd_0995fed8}`
